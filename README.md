## Concordance-Based Batch Effect Correction for Large-Scale Metabolomics 

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/BorchLab/CordBat/blob/main/www/CordBat_hex.png" width="305" height="352">

This is a R package implementation of the Concordance-Based Batch Effect Correction for Large-Scale Metabolomics (CordBat). If using the package please read and cite the [original manuscript](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05748). There is no methodologic change within the CordBat package from the original publication, however, substantial changes have been made ot imrpove computational efficiencies and limit iterative loops. This work was done in conjunction with [Eric Taylor](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/physiology/profile/eric-taylor) at the University of Iowa.
